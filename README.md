## Installation
To install the application locally, ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/) installed, then clone the repository from Github and run the installation script ```npm run install``` followed by the start script ```npm run start```. Ignore the seeding functionality as that component is still in progress.

## Usage
To explore the API, use a REST client such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/) to view, create, update and delete (CRUD) routes.
